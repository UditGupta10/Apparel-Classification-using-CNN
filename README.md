# Apparel-Classification-using-CNN

Apparel classification from images finds interesting applications in several domains such as e-commerce, online
marketing and video surveillance. In this project, we
proposed a deep learning architecture to classify an apparel
from a given image using convolutional neural networks. We
have also described several variants of our architecture in
terms of trainable weights and pre-trained models used. The
performance of all the variant models are reported over different modalities such as test set accuracy, confusion matrix
etc. We have also reported some insights and inferences we
gained by assessing combined performance of all the variants
